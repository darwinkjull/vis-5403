# My BIOM5403 Visualization Project
This is a simple D3 visualization developed for the BIOM5403 course.
 **Note: This data is artificially generated**
My goal with this project was to develop my skills at designing effective data visualizations, as I expect to use libraries such as D3 for my thesis work.

As of the latest revision, I have not yet figured out how to get this in a static format for hosting off of github pages. Please build and run the site locally for now.
