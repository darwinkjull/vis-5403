This is my first D3 project, developed for the BIOM5403 course. <br/>
üîó My visualization is now [hosted on vercel](https://vis-5403-darwinkjulls-projects.vercel.app/)! <br/>
‚ùó **Note: This data is artificially generated** (See below for details)

### Features:
- üñåÔ∏è Fast & expressive data visualization using D3
- ü´Ä Synthetic electronic health record data generated using MATLAB

### The Visualization:
![Visualization Demo](https://github.com/darwinkjull/vis-5403/raw/main/README_static/Kapture_Demo.gif)

I developed a visualization using the D3 JavaScript library to visualize the frequency of cardiovascular conditions in a set of artificial electronic health records. The visualization was developed to allow for users to complete the following tasks:

1. Make comparisons between the frequency of different cardiovascular conditions across
   - i) age
   - ii) sex
2. Identify features in the distribution of each cardiovascular condition, such as
   - i) the range
   - ii) the mode
   - iii) the median

### The Dataset:
![File Exchange Dataset](https://github.com/darwinkjull/vis-5403/raw/main/README_static/Matlab_FE_Capture.png)

The dataset used in this visualization is generated using a MATLAB script. You can view and run the script through the üîó [Mathworks File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/177384-biom5403-synthetic-dataset-generator).
